## Dashboard Description:
I built this dashboard to serve the persona of a global environmentalist, who will want to visualize the progress that has been made towards reducing climate change over the years, with a special interest in the progress across countries. An accurate measure of this progress can be obtained by visualizing the amount of emissions of different chemicals. This dashboard lets them compare different countries down to the emission of specific chemicals like greenhouse gasses, toxic gasses, etc. over time (since 1990) to overall get a better understanding of the global climate. It also provides desciptions of a few of the most important environmental legislations that have been passed in the past few decades. The dashboard can help show their affect on the emissions of various countries.

## Dashboard Building Process:
I built the dashboard by using Plotly express to create the various insightful graphs, as well as Dash to implement interactivity with callbacks as well as the overall layout of the page. I also needed to use custom css to be able to style the layout and give my app a theme according to the specific way I wanted.

## Strengths and Learning Experiences:

Through building this dashboard, I exercised strong skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization concepts. My biggest learning experiences were around learning how to be
adaptable with technology, as even though this is the first time I have used these tools (Plotly express and Dash) I was able to create a high quality and useful dashboard. I also
exercised problem solving, as it took effort to think about the best possible way to effectively communicate my data in an intuitive way with a user centric focus.
